# Date: 02 October 2024


#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - The talk from the last meeting helped me quite a lot with some ideas for this week and also for the future.

#### What did you achieve?

    - Updated the scatter plot with log scale and included the usabilityRating condition (if usabilityRating > 0.5 then I color the dot green if it's smaller then I leave it red).
    - Made a line plot to see how the number of datasets with "ISIC" word in the title increases over the years in Kaggle (could be changed to monthly as well).
    - I started just writing a bit on Overleaf to break the ice. 

#### What did you struggle with?

    - Nothing something to be specifically mentioned.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    -  I will keep looking into the original data and duplicates and see if there is something else during the week. Can't think of something concrete right now.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - What do you think of the new plots?

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - Will be filled after the meeting.

#### Any other topics

    - N/A



## Date: 25 September 2024


#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - Reading some material about Croissant and Kaggle API.

#### What did you achieve?

    - Got the metadata in croissant format for all datasets in Kaggle which have the word "ISIC" in the title and saved it in a csv file.
    - Did some basic exploration of the data to understand what's going on with those duplicate datasets.
    - Did two scatter plots to idenfity if there is any correlation between contentSize VS downloadCount and contentSize VS usabilityRating.
    - Submitted my Prelimary Problem Statement :). 

#### What did you struggle with?

    - Well I spent a bit more time to get the metadata in croissant format since I haven't worked with it before.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - Get the data from the orginial dataset and try to compare it randomly with one of the duplicate datasets just for inital check.
    - Try to find/read some literature about duplicate investigation in image datasets.
    - Start writing in overleaf report :).

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - Is there a specific format for the coding part, does it matter how I write my code? Should I structure so it looks nice with titles and stuff ? 
    - Can we have a quick look in which dataset of ISIC to pick as the original one from their official website ?

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - Get both lists, not only the ones that have ISIC word in the title, so the ones that have the word ISIC in description as well, if any.
    - Do a plot for how many have ISIC word in a description and title and compare.
    - For the scatter plot, log the downloadCount for x-axis and color the dots with condition that if usabilityRating is lower color the dots closer to red color if the usabilityRating is high color them green (leave them how they are).
    - Make a csv file with all the information of ISIC datasets through years and then pick one of the earlier years for comparison.
    - Find which papers use which datasets of ISIC if any (literature review).
    - Maybe a look into the carbon footprint of storing those datasets.
    - Try to get the info when those duplicate datasets where uploaded in Kaggle, have kinda plot with timelines.

#### Any other topics

    - It would be great if you could explain the process of contributing and co-authoring the paper as I mentioned in the previous emails.




## Date: 11 September 2024


#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - GitHub repo shared last week from the project you already started.
    - Reading literature and stuff related to the topic.

#### What did you achieve?

    - Finished writing the Preliminary Project Statement, read a bit of literature and material around the topic, set up the Kaggle API.

#### What did you struggle with?

    - Kinda having small struggles with Kaggle API, haven't used it before so I am reading documentation and relevant material.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - I have no idea for now since I won't have that much time this week, will update this later.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - Any suggestion on using a specific python version, since you already worked around this project what python version did you use? I am currently on 3.9.6. Asking so I could prevent having issues with libraries.
    - Is everything okay with the Preliminary Project Statement, any changes need to be made?

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - N/A

#### Any other topics

    - I will be attending an event in London next week on 18.09.2024 so I won't be in Copenhagen and I can't attend the meeting and will have almost little to no time to work this week because I also have a childhood friend visiting me on the weekend.

    - I didn't struggle with anything this week since I just started :).

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - Finish the Preliminary Project Statement.
    - Start investing the data more in detail and get some hands in it.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - I am a bit confused since there are a lot of ISIC datasets each year from 2016 should I pick a specific year or just go with all of them, also I am literatlly not sure which one is the original dataset that I should use it to compare, is it the one from this url I guess https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2016 ? 
    - Can you share the github repo of the research which you guys already did ? 

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - Continue working on what I already planned working this coming week.
