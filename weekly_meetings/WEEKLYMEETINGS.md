## Date: 25 September 2024


#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - Reading some material about Croissant and Kaggle API.

#### What did you achieve?

    - Got the metadata in croissant format for all datasets in Kaggle which have the word "ISIC" in the title and saved it in a csv file.
    - Did some basic exploration of the data to understand what's going on with those duplicate datasets.
    - Did two scatter plots to idenfity if there is any correlation between contentSize VS downloadCount and contentSize VS usabilityRating.
    - Submitted my Prelimary Problem Statement :). 

#### What did you struggle with?

    - Well I spent a bit more time to get the metadata in croissant format since I haven't worked with it before.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - Get the data from the orginial dataset and try to compare it randomly with one of the duplicate datasets just for inital check.
    - Try to find/read some literature about duplicate investigation in image datasets.
    - Start writing in overleaf report :).

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - Is there a specific format for the coding part, does it matter how I write my code? Should I structure so it looks nice with titles and stuff ? 
    - Can we have a quick look in which dataset of ISIC to pick as the original one from their official website ?

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - Get both lists not only the ones that have ISIC word in the title, does the description if any that is for ISIC, do a histogram for how many have isic word in a description and title
    - For the plot log the downloadCount for x-axis and color the usabilityRating for the ones that are lower closer to red and the higer ones leave it green 
    - Make a csv file with all the years information and then pick one of the earlier years
    - Reasons which papers use which datasets (find some papers that use ISIC datasets and do a literature review)
    - Carbon footprint of storing those datasets
    - Get a data when they where uploaded to have a plot with timeline (would have been a nice plot)
    - 

#### Any other topics

    - It would be great if you could explain the process of contributing and co-authoring the paper as I mentioned in the previous emails.

#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - GitHub repo shared last week from the project you already started.
    - Reading literature and stuff related to the topic.

#### What did you achieve?

    - Finished writing the Preliminary Project Statement, read a bit of literature and material around the topic, set up the Kaggle API.

#### What did you struggle with?

    - Kinda having small struggles with Kaggle API, haven't used it before so I am reading documentation and relevant material.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - I have no idea for now since I won't have that much time this week, will update this later.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - Any suggestion on using a specific python version, since you already worked around this project what python version did you use? I am currently on 3.9.6. Asking so I could prevent having issues with libraries.
    - Is everything okay with the Preliminary Project Statement, any changes need to be made?

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - N/A

#### Any other topics

    - I will be attending an event in London next week on 18.09.2024 so I won't be in Copenhagen and I can't attend the meeting and will have almost little to no time to work this week because I also have a childhood friend visiting me on the weekend.

#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - Notes taken from the first meeting with Veronika where we clarified the direction of the research.

#### What did you achieve?

    - Set up my github repo, overleaf, collected and read some literature, looked around to get more comfortable with the topic.

#### What did you struggle with?

    - I didn't struggle with anything this week since I just started :).

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - Finish the Preliminary Project Statement.
    - Start investing the data more in detail and get some hands in it.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - I am a bit confused since there are a lot of ISIC datasets each year from 2016 should I pick a specific year or just go with all of them, also I am literatlly not sure which one is the original dataset that I should use it to compare, is it the one from this url I guess https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2016 ? 
    - Can you share the github repo of the research which you guys already did ? 

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - Continue working on what I already planned working this coming week.
