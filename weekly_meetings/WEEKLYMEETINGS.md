#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - N/A

#### What did you achieve?

    - Wrote in overleaf.
    - Made the waffle charts but still a bit unsure about the way of showing my results.

#### What did you struggle with?

    - I really can't make my mind on what would be the best way to show my result so I am struggling with that a bit too much.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - I will try to finish the whole project for next week, either way the last draft deadline is 2 weeks.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - So you said 8 pages is the maximum for the paper, will 6-7 pages be acceptable as well or how it works ?
    - Do I need to upload the data when I upload the code in LearnIT? It's a lot of data. Out of what I have right now I think only the code folder looks like needs to be uploaded together with the data folder that I have but without the ISIC datasets.
    - Best design to reference papers ? 
    - Can we disscus a bit my research question, my conclusion and the way my results are shown with tables and plots if they actually align with each-other ?
    - I need to change my title of the research and contact SAP, what do you think of the current title of the paper?
    - I am just a bit concern... Is what I have enough? Does it need more work?
    - How will the exam be? Will there be needed a presentation to be done by my side in Slides? 

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - 2nd of December 9am send the draft.
    - 6-7 pages its fine.
    - Leave the duplicate and the original folder but just leave one image so the code runs and mention it in the README.md.
    - Use citep or citet for references.
    - I let Veronika know about my thesis next week.
    - Do the new table, check the picture in your phone, and just put one decimal after the precentage and calculate the perecentages in code.
    - Yes you can use the current title.
    - Update the waffle chart in the new design of the picture in your phone.
    - If you have different finding you do different subsections where the title of the subsection is the conculsion of that subsection, in the results section.
    - Similiar to Data in the Wild exam.
    - Look for some references in the Future work and Disscusion part, the research paper should have around 20 references.   Also you can add references about the background.
    - Make the new flowchart.

#### Any other topics

    - N/A




# Date: 13 November 2024



#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - Last weeks suggestions in the meeting.

#### What did you achieve?

    - Created tables for all the results on Overleaf as a first option of showing results.
    - Venn diagrams for the image counts results of subfolders of each dataset.
    - Methodology flowchart.

#### What did you struggle with?

    - N/A

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - If agreed on the plots and the way the results are shown I am going to write about my results in Overleaf.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - I made a few plots and a flowchart for the methods, would just like to discuss them. For some methods it's just I tried to throw a plot and show something but just nothing made sense, I believe using tables in Overleaf is a better option and I have them already created.

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - If you want to show the difference of the methods you should have them in one plot with maybe subplots.
    - Make a conclusion and based on that make plots.
    - Try to do a waffle chart and not a venn diagram, and if the results follow kinda accross all the pairs than maybe for the others just make a table where you show the results.
    - Update the flowchart, make it looks better and put the hash comparison in a different position because it looks like you are doing the hash comparison first or add order numbers.
    - Change the citation in Overleaf to not just numbers but to "name et al [number]".

#### Any other topics

    - N/A

# Date: 21 October 2024



#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - N/A

#### What did you achieve?

    - Chose three duplicate datasets for detailed analysis based on results I got from the size and name comparison of the kaggle datasets - selected one in each range of size difference in content size:  1-30%, 30-60% and 60-100%.
    - Comparison on number of images in train, val, test data was done for the picked datasets.
    - I had to go back and modify some code stuff I have done which was wrong and it took a bit of my time :).
   
#### What did you struggle with?

    - Everything :).

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - Filename comparison on image names.
    - Image dimensions comparison.
    - Write about this method in overleaf (had to do it this week but holiday...)

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - Can't think of something right now.

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    -  5th of December the other draft time to be sent, if you don't send on the 4th of November then you just don't get feedback but you dont maybe need to write a lot just write like small paragraphs for the methods.
    - No need to include masks in the analysis of data.

#### Any other topics

    - I am actually not sure if I will be able to deliver a proper draft by 4th of November somehow, I have another kinda hard project I need to finish in two weeks so I am not sure how much writing can I do in the meantime, would a week later like 11th of November be an option in case I won't be ready for the 4th?



# Date: 09 October 2024



#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - Making the plan/TO-DO list of what I see myself doing until the end of this research.

#### What did you achieve?

    - I made a TO-DO plan to follow because I felt lost and didn't know my next step.
    - Updated the old plots using the Plotly library and now they look so much better.
    - Made a csv file with all the information of orginal ISIC datasets through the years (didn't include 2024 one because it is so new like from one month ago and the competition just finished and there is still no information when it comes to test data size.)
    - Identified potential duplicates by comparing dataset sizes (contentSize) and matching the years mentioned in the names of both datasets.
   
#### What did you struggle with?

    - Thinking about what would be the most logical comparison of original and duplicate datasets, and I think I got what I wanted but need to discuss it.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - If agree on the plan, I will start downloading the data and start applying one of the methods for investigating duplicates more in detail (I plan to spend a week/week and a half for each method, if everything goes well).
    - Carbon footprint of storing all those datasets in Kaggle (I started looking this week but couldn't find anything so I contacted one of the associate proffesors if she has information about this).
    - Make a method section in overleaf and start writing about what that method is about and how I use it in my study.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - What are your thoughts on the idea of investigating the potential duplicates identified from the initial contentSize and year comparison (I can elaborate this more in the meeting)?
    - Can we just go through my TO-DO plan and check if we agree on at least as a plan (check weeklymeetings/TO_DO_PLAN_TO_FOLLOW.md)?
    - What do you think of the new plot (raincloud plot somehow) of the contentSize vs usabilityRating (you cannot see it on GitHub because it doesn't support the "Plotly" library that I used for making the plot. I can show it to you in the meeting)? I think this plot is a good one and it actually would be a good asset in the report. 
    - Do you know when my exam is going to be? 

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    -  Seperate the data sizes (training, test, validation) of the original dataset in csv file.
    -  Recheck the range of scenarios (1-20%, 20-50%, 50-100%), rank them by the size difference and then pick the top, middle, bottom one.
    -  You should only mention it in your report (that of course more storage is required etc and it's not "free"), but not go into estimating the carbon footprint of storing the datasets in Kaggle.
    -  Make something in the project that the procedure is algorithmic.
    -  Exam is probably not in December, 6-9 january, 20-24 january.
    -  Send draft for 4nd of November, kinda have the introduction, methods, results ...


#### Any other topics

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - The talk from the last meeting helped me quite a lot with some ideas for this week and also for the future.

#### What did you achieve?

    - Updated the scatter plot with log scale and included the usabilityRating condition (if usabilityRating > 0.5 then I color the dot green if it's smaller then I leave it red).
    - Made a line plot to see how the number of datasets with "ISIC" word in the title increases over the years in Kaggle (could be changed to monthly as well).
    - I started just writing a bit on Overleaf to break the ice. 

#### What did you struggle with?

    - Nothing something to be specifically mentioned.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - I will keep looking into the original data and duplicates and see if there is something else during the week. Can't think of something concrete right now.

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - What do you think of the new plots?

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - Try a raincloud plot for the latest scatter plot with usabilityRating and downloadCount.
    - Do different .tex files for different sections in Overleaf.
    - Check out web archive.

## Date: 25 September 2024


#### Who did you help this week?

    - N/A

#### What helped you this week?

    - Reading some material about Croissant and Kaggle API.

#### What did you achieve?

    - Got the metadata in croissant format for all datasets in Kaggle which have the word "ISIC" in the title and saved it in a csv file.
    - Did some basic exploration of the data to understand what's going on with those duplicate datasets.
    - Did two scatter plots to idenfity if there is any correlation between contentSize VS downloadCount and contentSize VS usabilityRating.
    - Submitted my Prelimary Problem Statement :). 

#### What did you struggle with?

    - Well I spent a bit more time to get the metadata in croissant format since I haven't worked with it before.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

    - Get the data from the orginial dataset and try to compare it randomly with one of the duplicate datasets just for inital check.
    - Try to find/read some literature about duplicate investigation in image datasets.
    - Start writing in overleaf report :).

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

    - Is there a specific format for the coding part, does it matter how I write my code? Should I structure so it looks nice with titles and stuff ? 
    - Can we have a quick look in which dataset of ISIC to pick as the original one from their official website ?

#### What are the agreements after this meeting? 

    - Get both lists, not only the ones that have ISIC word in the title, so the ones that have the word ISIC in description as well, if any.
    - Do a plot for how many have ISIC word in a description and title and compare.
    - For the scatter plot, log the downloadCount for x-axis and color the dots with condition that if usabilityRating is lower color the dots closer to red color if the usabilityRating is high color them green (leave them how they are).
    - Make a csv file with all the information of ISIC datasets through years and then pick one of the earlier years for comparison.
    - Find which papers use which datasets of ISIC if any (literature review).
    - Maybe a look into the carbon footprint of storing those datasets.
    - Try to get the info when those duplicate datasets where uploaded in Kaggle, have kinda plot with timelines.

#### Any other topics

    - It would be great if you could explain the process of contributing and co-authoring the paper as I mentioned in the previous emails.
